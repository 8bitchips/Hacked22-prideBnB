## Problem it Solves

- There are no incentives while playing a real-time game which for game like chess that needs skill and attention.
- Players can earn real value for their game skills and time.
- It helps to be a part of a decentralised way of betting environment through a trustless mechanism and without a 3rd party facilitator.

## Challenges we faced

- Diving into blockchain was intimidating, solidity has a high learning curve.
- Building a mobile-first web3 app was hard because of a lack of tooling for connecting and integrating with wallet.
- We started out short on time which made it very hard and challenging to integrate many features and build a functional app.
- Building a chess gaming app with a betting feature using web3 was demanding because of the complex logic.
- integrating multiple 3rd party services like stackOS, Filecoin and Matic was the trickiest part.
- We had very little blockchain knowledge and had not worked with sockets before so was a challenging learning experience.

## Enhancements

- Store all profile and game history on web3.storage.
- Builiding a chess community DAO for helping and funding community led competitions and events.
- Live in-app events.
- Support for connecting to a wallet like Trust wallet.
- Improving user experience on the game, and winning stake.
